### Do States Issue New Car Titles Without Checking for Liens on the Vehicle?

In most cases, **states do not issue new car titles without checking for liens on the vehicle**. However, there are some nuances and potential loopholes that can result in fraudulent title issuance.

### **General Process**
1. **Lien Check:**
    - When a vehicle title is transferred, states typically require a lien check. This ensures that no financial institutions or other entities have a claim on the vehicle.
    - If a lien exists, the title will often include a lienholder's name, and the lien must be satisfied before a clear title is issued.

2. **Lien Release Requirement:**
    - Sellers are usually required to provide a lien release document to demonstrate that the lien has been paid in full.
    - Without this, the buyer might not receive a clear title.

3. **DMV Coordination:**
    - Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs) or equivalent agencies coordinate with national and state lien databases to verify title and lien statuses.

### **Exceptions and Loopholes**
While most states have robust systems to check for liens, there are scenarios where titles may be issued improperly or fraudulently:

1. **Title Washing in Lenient States:**
    - Some states have less stringent rules or limited access to lien databases.
    - Scammers can register vehicles in such states to "wash" titles, removing liens or other negative designations (e.g., salvage status).

2. **Errors or Fraudulent Documents:**
    - Errors in DMV processing or the use of forged lien release documents can result in a title being issued without addressing existing liens.

3. **Private Party Sales:**
    - In private transactions, buyers might fail to check for liens, especially if they rely solely on the seller's documents.

### **How to Protect Yourself**
To avoid purchasing a vehicle with unresolved liens:
1. **Request a Vehicle History Report:**
    - Services like CARFAX or AutoCheck can show lien and title history.
2. **Verify Title with the DMV:**
    - Check the title directly with the DMV or the state agency issuing it.
3. **Obtain a Lien Release Letter:**
    - Insist on seeing a lien release document if the title indicates a lien.
4. **Be Wary of Out-of-State Titles:**
    - Titles issued in states known for lenient title regulations should be scrutinized carefully.

### **Summary**
States generally check for liens before issuing new titles, but loopholes like title washing, clerical errors, or fraudulent practices can allow titles to slip through without proper lien resolution. Always perform thorough due diligence when purchasing a vehicle.
