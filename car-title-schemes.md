Yes, there are fraudulent schemes where individuals purchase vehicles with loans in one state and then sell them in another state without settling the original loan, often by manipulating vehicle titles. This practice, known as "title jumping" or "title washing," involves transferring vehicle ownership without properly registering the title or concealing the vehicle's history to mislead buyers.

### **Common Scams**

#### **Title Jumping**
- This occurs when a vehicle is sold without the seller registering it in their name.
- The seller skips the title transfer to avoid taxes and fees, leaving the buyer with potential legal issues and undisclosed liens.

#### **Title Washing**
- This involves altering a vehicle's title to hide its history, such as branding due to damage or salvage status.
- Scammers may register the vehicle in states with lenient title laws to remove negative designations, deceiving buyers about the vehicle's true condition.

### **Real-World Examples**
- **Swansea, Massachusetts (October 2024):**
    - A dealer sold vehicles without providing titles, issuing fake temporary licenses instead.
    - Victims couldn't legally drive their purchased cars, and some vehicles were repossessed by auction houses due to unresolved ownership issues.

### **Protective Measures**
1. **Verify Title Authenticity**: Ensure the seller's name matches the title and check for any liens or brands indicating salvage or flood damage.
2. **Obtain a Vehicle History Report**: Services like CARFAX can reveal past accidents, title issues, and ownership history.
3. **Be Cautious with Out-of-State Titles**: Vehicles registered in another state may have undergone title washing. Investigate thoroughly before proceeding.
4. **Consult Professionals**: Have a trusted mechanic inspect the vehicle and consider legal advice to navigate the transaction safely.

By staying vigilant and conducting due diligence, you can protect yourself from falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.
