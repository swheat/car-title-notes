As of December 2024, the adoption of Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) systems varies across the United States. While many states have implemented ELT programs, some have not yet adopted these systems, relying instead on traditional paper-based processes.

### **States Without Electronic Lien and Title (ELT) Programs**

The following states do not currently offer ELT programs:

- **Arkansas**
- **Connecticut**
- **Kentucky**
- **Maine**
- **Minnesota**
- **Mississippi**
- **Missouri**
- **Montana**
- **New Hampshire**
- **New Mexico**
- **North Dakota**
- **Oregon**
- **Rhode Island**
- **Tennessee**
- **Utah**
- **Vermont**
- **Wyoming**

In these states, vehicle titles and lien recordings are managed through paper documentation, which can lead to delays and potential errors in lien recording and release. This reliance on manual processes may also increase the risk of fraudulent title transfers.

### **Implications of Non-ELT States**

In states without ELT systems, the absence of electronic lien management can result in:

- **Processing Delays**: Manual handling of paper titles can slow down transactions, affecting both lienholders and vehicle owners.
- **Increased Risk of Errors**: Handwritten documents are more susceptible to mistakes, potentially leading to disputes or legal challenges.
- **Fraud Vulnerability**: Paper-based systems may be more prone to fraud, such as title washing or the creation of counterfeit documents.

### **Benefits of ELT Systems**

States that have adopted ELT systems experience several advantages:

- **Improved Data Accuracy**: Electronic data exchange reduces typographical errors.
- **Faster Processing**: Eliminates mailing delays, allowing for quicker lien releases.
- **Enhanced Security**: Electronic records are less susceptible to loss or tampering.
- **Cost Savings**: Reduces expenses related to paper, printing, and postage.
